This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Gahl Levy (grlevy@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Konstantin Litovskiy (klitovsk@ucsc.edu)
We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
8 at most 25% of an individualâ€™s effort for an assignment should
9 be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
10 must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Gahl Levy spent ____ hours working alone.
Konstantin Litovskiy spent ____ hours working alone.
We spent ____ hours working together.
Gahl Levy spent ____ hours driving.
Konstantin Litovskiy spent ____ hours driving.
